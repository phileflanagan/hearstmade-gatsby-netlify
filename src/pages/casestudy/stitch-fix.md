# **The Ask**

Stitch Fix partnered with Hearst to capture content surrounding its 2019 red-carpet activation at the Columbus Circle subway station, as well as educate readers on the benefits of its styling services.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

We created a total of 15 Instagram posts and stories, one video, and two on-site articles based around Stitch Fixâ€™s Red Carpet Runway. Additionally, we produced three videos and three articles where Esquire, Cosmo, and ELLE editors tried and reviewed the Stitch Fix service.
