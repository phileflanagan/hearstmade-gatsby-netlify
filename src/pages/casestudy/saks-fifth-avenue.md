# **The Ask**

Saks came to us with the goal of driving purchase consideration among Harper’s BAZAAR and ELLE readers, and to reaffirm the luxury destination as the retail fashion authority in an ever-crowded landscape.

# **The Strategy**

Through the spring and fall fashion seasons, we positioned Saks as the leading trend experts for of-the-moment tastemakers, serving the freshest designers to women where they are now. In features showing how to [style bold evening-wear](https://www.elle.com/fashion/personal-style/a19663585/the-secret-to-wearing-springs-boldest-evening-looks/) with downtown irreverence and adapt [runway pieces for the sidewalk](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a19607665/the-runway-buy-3-statement-pieces-and-how-to-wear-them/), we enthusiastically translated top-tier fashion for the “now” generation.

Throughout 2018 we produced 10 pieces of custom content, 8 Instagram posts, and 29 sponsored articles. Through a mix of custom-shot longform stories and product-focused articles, we reached consumers throughout every stage of their purchase journey, from inspiration and trend research to shopping with intent.
