  The goal of our ambitious global program with Ritz Carlton was to elevate the
  perception of the brand among luxury consumers. In collaboration with Ritz
  Carlton, Harper’s BAZAAR and Esquire created five short films with
  up-and-coming directors that were distributed internationally, each shot at a
  different Ritz Carlton hotel. 


  In addition to the longform films, we produced 12 Instagram posts, 11
  trailers, and 24 pieces of service-focused travel content.
