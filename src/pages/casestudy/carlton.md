# **The Ask**

Our ambitious global program with Ritz Carlton was to elevate the perception of the brand among luxury consumers, increasing relevancy for today’s culturally immersed, on-the-pulse traveler, and aligning the hospitality brand with rich, heart-racing life experiences.

# **The Strategy**

In collaboration with Ritz Carlton, Harper’s BAZAAR and Esquire created five short films with up-and-coming directors that were distributed internationally, each shot at a different Ritz Carlton hotel.The Stay series followed disparate guests—a rebellious pair of friends, an enterprising child, two estranged women, a mysterious couple, strangers in adjacent rooms—as they checked in, and the high-adrenaline sequences that ensued. In addition to the long-form films, we produced 12 Instagram posts, 11 trailers, and 24 pieces of service-focused travel content.
