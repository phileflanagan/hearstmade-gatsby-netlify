# **The Ask**

In response to Stella Artois’ campaign prompt of living in the moment versus checking out on your phone, and its intent to elevate the brand, we created a digital-first program that aligned Stella Artois with Harper’s BAZAAR’s celebrated ICONS issue and annual star-studded event.

# **The Strategy**

Through a multi-asset experience, HearstMade invited audiences into the surreal world of BAZAAR ICONS. Leading with a custom narrative film shot at the famed Plaza Hotel, we wove a story of high-fashion adventure and excitement through this video, a complementary long-form article, and an in-magazine custom-content spread. Each iteration of the content featured highly produced imagery captured at the Plaza, starring a cast of beguiling influencers, that inspired viewers to disconnect from technology and raise a chalice (or bottle) of Stella Artois.

Our original film, A Night Untethered, won both the Audience Choice and Judges’ Choice Webby Awards in the Fashion & Lifestyle category in 2019.
