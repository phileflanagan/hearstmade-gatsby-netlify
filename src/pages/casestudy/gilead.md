# **The Ask**

Gilead wanted to align with a topic that was deeply important to the pharamacuetical company: the state of sex education in America, particularly as it affects LGBTQ+ individuals.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

**Through four deeply-reported longform features for Esquire, we [told the stories of five LGBTQ+ allies and activists](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a27479621/high-school-sex-education/) who grew up with very different sex education experiences; broke down what [sex education looks like across the country](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a27663524/sex-edcuation-in-america-state-by-state-1559243998/); advocated for a more inclusive sex education program through [a thoughtful first-person essay from Esquireâ€™s editor-at-large](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a27569998/comprehensive-sex-education-america/); and [compared different sex laws throughout all 50 states.](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/a27532397/state-by-state-sex-data/)**
