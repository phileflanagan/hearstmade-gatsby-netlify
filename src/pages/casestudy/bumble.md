# **The Ask**

Introduce the Bumble brand to new customers and also extend the dating-app maker’s relationship with its 50 million existing users.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

In April 2019, HearstMade launched Bumble Mag, a 150,000-circ publication focusing on real talk from real women who adore the brand and feel empowered by its positive, female-first messaging. In order to introduce Bumble’s fans to the company’s services beyond dating, the 100-page magazine devoted buckets of content to key areas of growth—friendship and careers, all told through the same bold voice the brand embodies. The magazine was distributed through Bumble’s 3000+ brand ambassadors across the country.
