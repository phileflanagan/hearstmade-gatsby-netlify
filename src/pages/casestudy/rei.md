# **The Ask**

Seattle-based outdoor retailer, REI, wanted to test consumer engagement beyond retail with a magazine that showcased the love of the outdoors through stories while still leaving room to highlight products.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

In September 2019, HearstMade partnered with REI to launchUnCommon Path, a quarterly publication promoting the brand’s message: “A life outdoors is a life well-lived.” With stories targeting both the outdoor enthusiast and the newcomer to outdoor adventure, the magazine helped solidify the retailer’s strong base of fans while engaging with a new audience eager for inspiration—and merchandise.

650,000 issues were distributed to targeted REI co-op members, and also sent with select Hearst titles.The magazine was also sold on newsstands and at all 155 REI stores.
