  readership is Airbnb’s host and guest community; it’s distributed to every
  Airbnb host in the United States and is also sold at newsstands and via
  subscription. Celebrating humanity and belonging, each issue is packed with
  narrative journalism, authoritative service articles, home features and
  stunning portfolios contributed by award-winning writers, photographers and
