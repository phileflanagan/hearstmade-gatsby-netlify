# **The Ask**

Olay came to Hearst with a goal of generating awareness and purchase consideration of their 2018 priority products among their target demo, which aligned squarely with the Marie Claire, ELLE, Cosmo, and Women’s Health readership.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

Throughout our seven-month program, we created 10 pieces of on-site custom content, 4 videos, and 12 sponsored Instagram posts. Top performers in regards to shopper engagement included this story on Cosmo about [how wearing SPF can change the way your makeup looks](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a25919420/how-wearing-spf-can-change-your-skin/); this story on ELLE that broke down [how to transform your skin in four weeks](https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a24633318/how-to-transform-your-skin-4-weeks/); and this story on Women’s Health about [the benefits of multi-masking](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a25098081/multi-masking-skincare-complexion/).
