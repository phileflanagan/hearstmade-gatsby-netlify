# **The Ask**

The purpose of our eight-month program with Tourism of Ireland was to generate interest among our audiences to travel to Ireland year-round, while highlighting the various cultural experiences, landmark destinations, and food and dining opportunities the island has to offer.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

The content we produced included one documentary-style video that [detailed how to experience Ireland through all five senses on Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a27483495/ireland-travel-guide/), which was then broken down into five social assets, as well as another video on Town & Country capturing [five of the most beautiful and historic must-sees landmarks](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/a27346001/five-amazing-destinations-in-ireland/). We also shot [an influencer-led travel guide to Belfast on ELLE](https://www.elle.com/life-love/a28005284/belfast-travel-guide/); created a list of [the best scenic drives](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/travel/a26027746/the-most-scenic-drives-in-ireland/) and [trail runs](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/g26027030/best-running-trails-ireland-dublin-kerry/) on Road & Track and Runnerâ€™s World, respectively; and packing guides on [Town & Country](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/a26023743/ireland-travel-packing-tips/) and [ELLE](https://www.elle.com/culture/g25778437/what-to-pack-for-a-trip-to-ireland/).
