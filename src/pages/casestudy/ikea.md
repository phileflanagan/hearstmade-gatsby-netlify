# **The Ask**

IKEA’s partnership with Good Housekeeping in 2018 and 2019 had one primary goal: to position the retailer *as the* place to go for any type of kitchen renovation.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

Leveraging the authority of Good Housekeeping, we guided shoppers through the entire process of buying, installing, and remodeling the most important elements of a new kitchen. To cover this topic as comprehensively as possible, we produced the [IKEA Kitchenpedia](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/kitchenpedia/), 26 pieces of content tackling every aspect of kitchen reno from how to pick the right [cabinets](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25141015/kitchenpedia-doors-and-drawers/) and [countertops](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25140712/kitchenpedia-countertops/) to installing an [island](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25385452/kitchenpedia-islands/) or [lighting system](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25398609/kitchenpedia-lighting/) to purchasing a new [refrigerator](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25713505/kitchenpedia-refrigerators/) and [stove](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/ocd/a25429739/kitchenpedia-ovens-and-stoves/), and so much more.
