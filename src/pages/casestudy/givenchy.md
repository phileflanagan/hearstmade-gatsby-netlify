# **The Ask**

The focus of our Givenchy Beauty campaign was to create a collection of cohesive, social-first content to drive awareness to Givenchy's new Le Rouge Liquide Lipstick.

###### \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

# **The Strategy**

As an onsite anchor, we created an immersive, custom-shot longform article on Harper’s BAZAAR. Within that story we embedded an equally rich full-length video. We then spun that captured footage into a series of six scroll-stopping video assets promoted socially across BAZAAR, ELLE, and Marie Claire, driving back to Givenchy’s product landing page. We later “refreshed” the original videos into a three-part series that garnered added relevancy during the holiday season.
